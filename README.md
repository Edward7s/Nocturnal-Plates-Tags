# Nocturnal-Plates
#### A mod that allows u to add your own nameplates and everyone who uses this mod can see them.

## How does it work:
#### Wen u enter the game a small window should pop out and ask u for a 7 digit pin, u will set your pin and the pin will be locked on your Uid;
#### If u try to connect from other pc or re install the game it will ask u again for the pin so it makes sure its u (Its not Ip locked or anything like that) so do not share your pin;
#### No one can change your tags or mess with them without having the pin, wen u set the pin it will take your apikey and check your userID;
#### No UserData except the userId and your Pin are stored on my server and the pin is also encrypted on my server.

## How to set a customTag:
#### U want to go to CVR directory and then to Nocturnal Folder then edit the file "PlatesLogInfo.json";
#### Then u want to replace the 2 tags from TagArr, U type whatever u want between the "";
#### If u want only  1 tag u will want to remove whatever is in the "" and the , before it and what's inside the "" To.
